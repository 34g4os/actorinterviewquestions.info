Inside is a beaten man, and Brad instructs Buddy to kill him with a knife, in order to become numb to the act. Buddy cries at first, but soon straightens up and stabs him.\nWhat caused the white flash Lisa? He describes the event as occurring suddenly, having been asleep at the time, only to be awoken by a bright white light. This effect is similar to that of the initial blast of a nuclear detonation: a large and bright white flash. This could mean that the White Flash was caused by some form of nuclear weapon.\nWhat happens to Lisa in Lisa? Lisa Armstrong was the sister of Brad Armstrong, and the protagonist of LISA: THE FIRST. Due to the physical and sexual abuse of Marty Armstrong, she committed suicide.\nWho is Buzzo in LISA: THE PAINFUL? Buzzo is the leader of the Joy Boys and a major antagonist in LISA: THE PAINFUL, seemingly having taken interest in Brad. Buzzo also confronts Brad on many occasions. He is a mysterious warlord who is heavily involved in Olathe’s Joy trade and offers Joy to Brad on many occasions.\nWhat did Brad do to Lisa? Since Brad is supposed to have been her primary caretaker as a small child but makes no appearance in the game, it’s most likely that he raped Lisa to reassert his own sense of power after putting up with Marty’s abuse, and then abandoned her as soon as she stopped being completely dependent on him.\nWhat did Brad do to Lisa?

In LISA: THE PAINFUL, it’s almost impossible to fight Buzzo due to his immense plot armor, so don’t take the decision to kill Buzzo. Even if you do manage to kill him, a game over will occur due to the fight being intended as impossible.\nWhat was Lisa made with? LISA Wiki.

There are 3 endings/achievements: Joyful, Joyless, and finishing the game in Pain Mode. You can only get 1 of these per play, and Pain Mode overrides the first two. Separately, you also get Selfish, Sorta Selfish, or Selfless 1 per run, because of a different event.Jul 10, 2015\nIs Lisa the first connected to Lisa the painful?
