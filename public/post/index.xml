      <description>Is Denis Villeneuve well known? David Ehrlich of IndieWire wrote, &amp;ldquo;Few filmmakers of the 21st century have risen to prominence and prestige with the forcefulness of Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve, whose seemingly unstoppable career has been bolstered by a steady balance of critical respect and commercial success.
Why Denis Villeneuve is so good? Whatever the French Canadian filmmaker touches simply turns to gold. His eye for striking visuals, his ability to extract show-stealing performances from his stars, and his near unmatched skill when tackling intense, edge-of-your-seat thrills have led many to dub Denis Villeneuve as the best director alive today.</description>
